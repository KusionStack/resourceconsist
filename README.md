# ResourceConsist
**ResourceConsist** ([official site](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/manuals/resourceconsist)) aims to make a 
customized controller can be realized easily, and offering the ability of following 
[**PodOpsLifecycle**](https://kusionstack.io/docs/operating/concepts/podopslifecycle) for controllers.

The only thing users need to do to realize a customized controller is writing an adapter implementing 
[ReconcileAdapter](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/blob/main/pkg/frame/controller/types.go#L67). 
For controllers following **PodOpsLifecycle**, 
[WebhookAdapter](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/blob/main/pkg/frame/webhook/types.go#L26) is 
also necessary to be implemented.

ü§†**Employer** is the entity responsible for managing and coordinating the utilization of another resource, 
similar to how a service selects and controls pods.

üë©‚Äçüíª**Employee** is the resource managed by another resource, like pods selected by service.

üëâ Please refer to [key concepts](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/docs/keyconcepts.md) 
to find out what ü§†**Employer**/üë©‚Äçüíª**Employee**/... are.

## üíª Get Started
### üîß Tutorial
**ResourceConsist** offers the frame for starting controller. 
Controllers started by adapters and resource consist frame can handle resources beyond or in cluster by themselves 
or cooperate with other controllers.

[DemoControllerAdapter](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/frame/controller/resourceconsist_controller_suite_test.go#L31)
is an adapter handles resources by itself, while [SlbControllerAdapter](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/adapters/alibabacloudslb/alibabacloudslb_controller.go#L35)
is an adapter handles resources cooperate with CCM controller.

With **ResourceConsist**, you can build a bridge between existing controllers and PodOpsLifecycle, just like what
SlbControllerAdapter](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/adapters/alibabacloudslb/alibabacloudslb_controller.go#L35) did.

## üéñÔ∏é Contribution guide
**ResourceConsist** is currently in its early stages. Our goal is to make a customized controller can be realized 
easily, especially for controllers following PodOpsLifecycle. 

We will continue implementing more common used traffic controller into 
[adapters](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/adapters)

üöÄ If you want to contribute to built-in adapters, you can start from contribute them into 
[experimental/adapters](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/experimental/adapters). 
We will move it into [adapters](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/tree/main/pkg/adapters) when the 
experimental adapters are ready to release.

We welcome everyone to participate in construction with us. Visit the [contribution guide](docs/contribution.md)
to understand how to participate in the contribution KusionStack project.
If you have any questions, please [submit the issue](https://github.com/KusionStack/resourceconsist/issues).
